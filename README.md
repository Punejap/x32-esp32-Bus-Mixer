# x32-esp32-Bus-Mixer
This project uses an esp32 to control a single stereo bus of a Behringer x32 digital mixer. The intention of the design is to allow a musician to quickly edit their in-ear monitoring mix via simple, physical control interface. The project requires an ESP32 dev-kit, 4 rotary controllers, 4 LCD screens, and 4 LED rings.
